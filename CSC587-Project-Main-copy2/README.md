Notable paths:

/code/DoHlyzer -- source code for DoHlyzer

/code/capture -- main path that contains all scripts used to generate and capture DNS packets as well as analyzing

Notable files:

packetGeneration.py -- Python script for generating random DoH and non-DoH data.

packetCapture.sh -- Bash script for executing tcpdump and capturing traffic generated by packetGeneration.py
                    into a pcap file.

doHlyzer.sh -- Bash script for processing the pcap file using dohlyzer, outputting the results to a .csv file.
               Additionally, it tags the traffic as DoH or non-DoH based on IP addresses using add-labels.py.
